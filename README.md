For the script/.exe to run you need to (assuming you are on windows os):
  1) press win+r
  2) type "shell:startup"
this will open the startup folder easily
then drop the .exe shortcut from the ./dist to the startup folder


note: you can change the icon of the executable file if u want but need to rebuild the exe using pyinstaller.
